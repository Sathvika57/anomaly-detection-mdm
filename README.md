 # Anomaly Detection in MDM Logs using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting unusual or suspicious patterns (anomalies) in **Mobile Device Management (MDM) logs** using machine learning.  
The system helps identify:
- Policy violations
- Unauthorized activities
- Potential security threats
- Device failures or unusual logs
