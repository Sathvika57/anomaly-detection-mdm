# 📊 Anomaly Detection in Mobile Device Management (MTM Blocks) Using Machine Learning

### 🧾 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting unusual or unexpected activities (anomalies) within **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** logs such as:
- Device check-in failures  
- App installation issues  
- SIM swaps  
- Location update anomalies  
- Security compliance drifts  

By leveraging **Python**, **Machine Learning (Isolation Forest)**, and a **Streamlit-based dashboard**, the system automatically detects, logs, and visualizes anomalies in real time.
